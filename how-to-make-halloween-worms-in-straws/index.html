Chill until gelatin is firm, at least 8 hours, or cover and chill up to 2 days.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://gail-brekke.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FUW/0ZY9/GT19NK8M/FUW0ZY9GT19NK8M.jpg?frame=1&amp;amp;width=2100" alt="Bowl of Worms Anyone?
