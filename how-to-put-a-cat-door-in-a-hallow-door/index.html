Using the template that comes with your cat door kit, trace the door and make sure it is at least 3″ from all door edges. This simple cat flap is basically a hinged pet door that opens with a slight push, without requiring you to open the front door. The kitty pass is a frame that fits into a cutout you make in any door (you still have to have some cutting skills!) the front of the frame has cat ears and the back has a tail! Attach the exterior frame of the cat door with screws.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://gail-brekke.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://img.chewy.com/is/image/catalog/130058_PT5._AC_SL1500_V1499290951_.jpg alt="SureFlap DualScan Cat Door, White" title="SureFlap DualScan Cat Door, White" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://gail-brekke.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
